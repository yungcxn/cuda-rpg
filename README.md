# cuda-rpg

This project explores CUDA+Vulkan interoperability, blazingly fast render performance through SIMT optimization techniques from CUDA and AVX-SIMD stragies.

Its underlying system is heavily influenced by Entity-Component-Systems, but refined for the use of CUDA.

## Dependencies

- X11 (Linux) + headers
- Vulkan headers
- CUDA (and CUDA-able GPU)
- CPU with AVX2

## Compilation

```bash
make
```

## The plan

I need to add the following 
- Basic rendering & logic
- Tiles, Animations, SFX system
- Magic, Shops, Skills, Prefabs, Items
- Statistics, GUIs
- NPCs, Mobs, Quests, Dialogue, Factions
- AI, morgue
- hacking, cybernetics, alchemy, crafting
